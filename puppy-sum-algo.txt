To find the sum of the integers from 1 to N, d times
ie,if d=2 then we need to calculate sum((sum(n)))
sum from 1 to N, and each subsequent time n is the result of the previous operation.
1. Start
2. read no of test case:t
3. for i <t:
    3.1 read d(sum applied d times),n:
    3.2 while(d>0):
          n=sum(n)
          d=d-1
4.Stop

Function sum()
Input:n to find sum from 1 to n
Output:Sum of n integers
1.Start
2.initialise sum s
3.for i from 1 to n:
    sum+=i
4.return sum
5.Stop
